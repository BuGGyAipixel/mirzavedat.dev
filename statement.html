  <h1>Personal Statement – Mirza Vedat Ketanci</h1>

  <p>My name is Mirza Vedat Ketanci. I am 17 years old and a citizen of the Republic of Turkiye. I completed my high school education at Robert Academy in the United States. Prior to that, I studied at London Academy in Casablanca. I am currently residing in Morocco.</p>

  <p>In 2019, while I was a middle school student at London Academy Casablanca, I actively participated in the school's robotics team. That same year, our team became the national champion of Morocco in a competition organized by VEX Robotics. As a result, we had the honor of representing Morocco at the 2019 VEX Robotics World Championship held in Kentucky, USA.</p>

  <p>I aim to study Information Management. I have a strong interest in technology, programming, and data science. I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive Data Science and Machine Learning course at TechPro Education, a U.S.-based institution. I am also working on various practical projects related to Python, data analysis, and web development.</p>

  <p>My goal is to build a professional career in information technology and contribute to innovative projects on a global scale.</p>
